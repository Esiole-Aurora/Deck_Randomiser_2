This repository is the updated version of a VB.NET program I made to take a random selection of Magic: The Gathering decks, upgraded in C#.
Functionality has been added including a hypergeometric calculator to tweak land counts, random card fetch using scryfall API, modifying the list of decks available from within the app and fetching rulings from scryfall API
